1.Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

     Version control- is a software tool or system that allows programmers to track changes made to code over time, manage different versions of the codebase, and collaborate on projects.
      Versioning: Each change to the code is assigned a unique version number, creating a history of the codebase's evolution.
      Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously, with version control preventing conflicts and overwriting changes.
      Branching: Developers can create branches from the main codebase to create experimental or parallel versions without affecting the main code.
      Merging: Changes from branches can be brought back to the main codebase through a merge process, allowing for easy integration of contributions.
      
          GitHub is a popular because:
     Open source: It's free to use for open-source projects and provides a wide range of features.
     Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration between developers through features like pull requests, code reviews, and discussion threads.
     Project management: It integrates with other tools like issue trackers and project boards, providing a comprehensive solution for project management.
     Code hosting: It offers secure and reliable hosting for code repositories, ensuring accessibility and backups.

Version control helps maintain project integrity by:

        Preventing data loss: Changes are recorded and tracked, minimizing the risk of losing code or reverting to an earlier version.
        Establishing a single source of truth: The version control system acts as a central repository, ensuring that all team members have access to the latest and official version of the codebase.
        Facilitating bug tracking and resolution: Changes and versions are documented, making it easier to identify the root cause of bugs and track their resolution.
        Enforcing code quality: Version control allows for code reviews, ensuring that changes meet the project's standards and best practices.
